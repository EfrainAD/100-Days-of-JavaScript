# 100-Days-of-JavaScript

## Day One 
<p>I can't use something.innterTest > 0, but I CAN with innerHTML, so something.innerHTML > 0 does worked.</p>
<p>I can add eventListener to a contaner and have the element inside trigger it. Then I find out what one was clicked by using e.target to get the class name.</p>
<p>With above, a bitfall is that any element inside it will not trigger. "contaner > button > <i>" The i will not have the class name that button has. So careful</p>
<p>count.innerText = ++(count.innerText) can be count.innerText++</p>

## Day Two
<p>Better understood Math.random() now.</p>

## Day Three
<p>Cool Way to generate the numbers in one lne.</p>
