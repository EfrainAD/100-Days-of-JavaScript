# 100-Days-of-JavaScript

## Day One 
<p>I can't use something.innterTest > 0, but I CAN with innerHTML, so something.innerHTML > 0 does worked.</p>
<p>I can add eventListener to a contaner and have the element inside trigger it. Then I find out what one was clicked by using e.target to get the class name.</p>
<p>With above, a bitfall is that any element inside it will not trigger. "contaner > button > <i>" The i will not have the class name that button has. So careful</p>
<p>count.innerText = ++(count.innerText) can be count.innerText++</p>

## Day Two
<p>Better understood Math.random() now.</p>

## Day Three
<p>Cool Way to generate the numbers in one lne.</p>

## Day Four
<p>Got a needed reminder that form submit refreshes the page.</p>
<p>I now have a better understanding of position: absolute; </p>
<p>Learned how add closing animations to a modal.</p>

## Day Five
<p>I like my solution better. Less operations while being easier to read too</p>

## Day Six
<p>The .match(/([a,e,i,o,u])/) use was much nicer then mine solution. I really need to sit down and learn regex.</p>

## Day Seven
<p>So day seven gave me this little gum. I was getting an odd errer when I would tab over the the submit button verse just clicking on it.</p>
<blockquote>Assertion failed: Input argument is not an HTMLInputElement</blockquote>
<p>Turns out it a lastpass error.</p>
<p>This had all kinds of learning. I googled how to copy. I learned from the solution I can "select/highlight" the text. I think that a very nice touch.</p>

## Day Eight
<p>Wish they just gave directions so I didn't need to watch to figure out what it was to do. Then again maybe I should have ran the solution and guessed. I really don't want add video or audio to my google drive, but There is one place I wonder if maybe cold cause issues when working with the URL.</p>

## Day Nine
<p>Simple. I never used input before through the event listener.</p>
<p></p>

## Day Ten
<p>The solution given was much nicer. Mine only checks for a netwrok connection. Fetching a picture with a time stamp on the url so it wouldn't use your stored one was very nice.</p>

## Day Eleven
<p>I have never actaully seen class within class like that. I never had understood what that chaining looked like that I do all the time with premade librarys we use. Using pre-made and making your own definitely seem different at frist glance. I'm sure iwth more exposure, my mind can sttart thinking in that way.</p>

## Day Twelve
<p>Needed to see video to understand what was wanted, so this is on hold for later so I have time to forget what I saw.</p>
<p>Need to be careful about web browser security. And to change web broswers.</p>

## Day Thirteen
<p>Another needed to see video to understand what was wanted, so this is on hold for later so I have time to forget what I saw.</p>
<p>Back, definitly forgot what I saw. I read up it to get it. The solution was easer to read then mine without knwoing anything. I pulled from the example code on MDN.</p>
<p>I did learn if I add two js files in one html, my delairing carries over to te second file.</p>

## Day Fourteen
<p>Saw video coming back to it another day.</p>
<p></p>

## Day Fifteen
<p>Got date stuff reinforced. And a typo reinforced that I can use backticks/(template literals) in objects</p>

## Day Sixteen
<p>Got new idea to just change the display block and display none. I was remaking the list everytime. I did look to see if there was any nice build in way to add and take way form a li, there doesn't seem to be.</p>
